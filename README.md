# Drone
Repository dedicated to the design of a DIY quadcopter, with related technical documentation.
## Repository Tree description
"Drone" is the main folder containing all the documentation and script associated to the project.
The repository is composed of three different sub-directories:
- doc: contains the documentation of the project and datasheets of the components;
- arduino_scripts: contains the main script and functions, other than usefull libraries and modules;
- matlab_scripts: contains Matlab and Simulink simulation codes.
## Aim of the project
The goal of this project is to apply the engineering knowledge acquired during a bachelor’s degree to real-world problems, while also developing practical skills in electronics, sensor fusion, control theory, and flight mechanics.

As of May 2024, the project is being carried out by a second-year Aerospace Engineering student. The documentation is intentionally written to be accessible and easy to understand—even for readers without a STEM background—by including detailed explanations and insights into the various topics.

This approach not only helps me develop a critical mindset toward problem-solving, but also provides a clear and well-structured resource for anyone looking for a simple (yet technically accurate) guide.
