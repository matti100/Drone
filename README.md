# Drone
Repository dedicated to the design of a DIY quadcopter, with related technical documentation.
## Repository Tree description
"Drone" is the main folder containing all the documentation and script associated to the project.
The repository is composed of three different sub-directories:
- doc: contains the documentation of the project and datasheets of the components;
- arduino_scripts: contains the main script and functions, other than usefull libraries and modules;
- matlab_scripts: contains Matlab and Simulink simulation codes.
## Aim of the project
The aim of the project is to apply engineering knowledge acquired in any bachelor degrees to real-life problems, but foremost develop "on-the-field" skills related to electronics, sensor fusion, control-systems and propulsion.
As of today, May 2024, the project is carried by a second-year Aerospace Engineering student and the documentation
is meant to be simple and understandable to everyone, even to those who don't have a STEM background, with plenty of
explanations and insights to the topics. In this way, me personally has the opportunity to develop a critic approach to the problem, other than
leaving a clear documentation for those who are looking for a well-explained, simple (but not incorrect) "manual".
