# Quadcopter build and programming manual

You are about to embark on an exciting journey... building and programming a quadcopter from scratch. This manual will guide you every step of the way, explaining the essentials on aeronautics, electronics and embedded programming. All components are commercially available and all programs are fully hackable, meaning that you can adapt anything you want and create a quadcopter capable of stuff that goes way beyond the scope of this manual! 

This manual is complemented with the Youtube video series, that corresponds with each chapter: https://www.youtube.com/@carbonaeronautics

The quadcopter frame design files are available as well on the Open Source Hardware Lab: https://oshwlab.com/droneer/Carbon-Aeronautics-Quadcopter

Good luck and most importantly: have fun!
